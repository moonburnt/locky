*Dead-simple action verification mechanism, written in about half hour*

# Locky

## Description:

**Locky** is an extremely lazy and simple action verification mechanism. Its goal

been matched (I've made it for personal use in GUIs - to ensure that confirmation
button only become available after all necessary fields has been filled)
